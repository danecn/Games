This is a compilation of games I've made.

I use Eclipse to run my program. Each of the folders in the src folder were packages in Eclipse. The Pictures
folder needs to be saved in the same place as the src folder so that the images appear in the program.
I'm going to try to get an executable for the program when I can.

Games
Single Target Shooter
One target moves around the screen and the objective is to shoot it. The target can be changed in the Options
menu to show different images. Backgrounds change based on the target image.

Multi Target Shooter
Multiple targets move around the screen. A list of targets is on the right side of the screen. You gain a point
for shooting a target and lose a point for shooting a non-target.

Controls for Shooter
Mouse to move crosshair
Left click to shoot
'P' to pause/unpause game
'R' to restart game

Hangman
Two player hangman. One person chooses a word and the otehr guesses. Turns are switched and score is kept.

Fermi
You must guess a random 3 digit number. Nano means none of the numbers you guessed are in the answer. Pico
means one of your guesses is in the answer but in the wrong position. Fermi means one of the numbers is in
the right position and in the answer.
